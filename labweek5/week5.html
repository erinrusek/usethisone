<h1>Week 5: CSS</h1>

<h2>Exercise Response:</h2><br><br>
This was so freaking cute omg. I would use a lot of these properties before they were <br>explained to me in Flexbox Froggy and Grid Garden without knowing what I was doing<br>(usually I’d have to go to stack overflow or would pick random words that seemed right). <br>I had actually been doing this puzzle piece method since I started coding, so it was <br>actually really cool to see the logic behind the properties. <br><br>
Although at the beginning, Flexbox Froggy and Grid Garden seemed easy, I did not expect <br>it to get so intense, and to be honest I’m still a little confused about flex boxes.<br> However, it was super helpful to list out the properties and their subsections (ex: <br>flex-direction= row; row-reverse; column; column-reverse) so that even when things did get confusing, <br>I still had a directory in front of me. <br><br>It was also really nice when the interface changed automatically so I didn’t have to keep refreshing <br>the page as is status quo (JavaScript trick I’m guessing?). Nevertheless, it was a really nice <br>exercise and I’m excited to practice grids and flex boxes more in the future.<br><br><br><br>
