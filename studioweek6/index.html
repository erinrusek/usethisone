<h2>Response: Hypertext of Claire Evans’ BroadBand</h2><br><br><br>

When I think of the internet today, it’s hard for me to break out of that link to link connection we’re all so used <br>to. It’s another conversation, but it’s definitely a dangerous pattern to get stuck in, as link to link, as explained <br>by the chapter, isn’t the only way to think about accessing information on the World Wide Web.<br><br>
When Evans was explaining Wendy Hall’s logic behind Microcosm, it was quite hard for me to follow because I had to <br>re-define my definition of link. The idea that a link could matter more than the actual content on separate pages is <br>so foreign to me because the way I’ve always used the internet was dependent on this “search and find” method. It <br>makes me wonder what the internet might look like if we had adopted Microcosm’s interface. If the internet of today <br>is a “supernova,” might the Microcosm net look more like separate solar systems? It makes me a little disappointed <br>that links have been thrown to the wayside. Links could be so helpful in organizing a now massive web that’s hard <br>to make sense of. They could also create pertinent algorithms for individual users, which our current net doesn’t <br>care about. But like Cathy Marshall mentioned, the users are the program. To me, this statement just points to the <br>fact that although a program is meant to do “x,” people are always going to find a way to transform it into <br>something outside of the developer’s original perception of a particular program’s allowance. <br><br>
Perhaps this points to a future on the web where links become more useful than they currently are. It’s not too hard<br> to imagine that when the internet becomes too commercialized and overrun with so many different voices, then <br>personalized experiences could begin to take hold to give users a feeling of individualism on the web again.<br>

<h3>Questions:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Is there a way to give power back to the users regarding online programs? The users are the program, so isn’t it<br> inherent that they should have some role in designing programs distributed to the public?</li><br>
<li>How does a link in essence become useful? It’s hard to imagine given the only power its granted currently is <br>connecting to larger, more “important” pages. But given more attention, could links become a net unto themselves?</li>

</ol>
