<h3>Metaphors We Live By: Response</h3>

	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe way different cultures tie their specific values into metaphors <br>is something that really fascinates me. Not just because it provides deeper insight to that<br> culture, but also because metaphors “break the fourth wall” in an almost comical way. When <br>referring to cultures, orientational metaphors among the other types are an incredibly rudimentary <br>yet expressive figures of speech (for example: up=happy, down=sad, forward=future, etc.) If I was <br>to relate this orientation metaphorical thinking to the web, I would say it functions in quite <br>a similar way.<br>
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAt a first glance, computers seem to function on a completely <br>different plane than human thinking.Programs run on binary and wires with seemingly automatic <br>decision-making. If most people were to place computers and humans on a scale, they’d be pretty far<br> apart from one another. I believe though, that the computer like many other man-made tech, is <br>not as distant as we may think. Because the web was thought up, constructed and is consistently<br> used by human beings, the computer must function in a way that we can understand. When it <br>doesn’t, we are confused and Raymond Loewy’s MAYA principle comes into effect. <br>
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThus, the need to section HTML code with separate divs, and the <br>linking of a CSS document with its HTML counterpart are comprehensible to humans as the <br>metaphorical “division,” and the “link” which connects us to the rest of the web (as well as to <br>each other in communal terminology). In a broader sense of the web, the metaphorical play between <br>the meaning of the word compute in both a technological and mental context displays the subtle <br>connection between us and the computer. Even scroll functions (up to down, mimicking our reading <br>patterns) move along with our physical orientation (perhaps why it’s sometimes unnatural to <br>scroll sideways on a website).

<h4>Questions:<br></h4>
<br>
<ol>
<li>In terms of website design, I wonder how many failures there have been in website<br>
launches because the interface didn’t fall in line with the human sense of orientational<br>
metaphor. What if a website were coded to suit the orientational metaphor of a tree or a<br>
bug (I wonder if we’d get a new perspective on our own world)?</li><br>
<li>Because the web could be seen as an extension of ourselves, what does this mean for the<br>
future of “online culture”? Will we see conflict being brought into the web just as it takes<br>
place in this world? Will certain webs inherit cultural taboos or punishments differing<br>
from other ones? Will we see the rise of factions creating a sort of “lawless land”?</li><br>
</ol>

<h3>Metalogue: Response</h3>

Although comparing a dance to the body and blood of Christ may seem a little out there in terms of <br>computers and the web, I think there’s many important messages to take from Bateson’s Metalogue. I was <br>confused at first as to how I might go about assigning a metaphor to the computer/the web, when I <br>realized that we are living this comparison right now. As the web becomes an extension of our minds, <br>we are continuing to blur the line between the digital world and reality.<br>
	To begin, Bateson attempts to establish the meaning of the phrase “sort of” to his daughter in <br>context with the idea that a doll was “sort of” like a human. “Sort of,” in this sense emits an <br>uncanny sentiment and, because of this uncomfort, naturally draws the comparison apart. Thinking in <br>terms of the web, this uncanny rift such as a browser tracking someone’s movement or an <br>algorithm predicting what someone might want to search next, brings an air of discomfort. It <br>creates the notion that the computer is “sort of” human, something we generally find eerie. Not <br>only can this make us uncomfortable, but it can also cause issues. Technology predicting thought <br>can become too reliable making people dependent, or perhaps in a rather dystopian fashion, replace <br>human interaction altogether. <br>
	To keep the web, computers, algorithms and humanity separate is something I feel has been debated <br>for a while. Those with fears for the future of A.I. I believe to a certain extent see the <br>metaphor of the human aligned the computer potentially dangerous. What I think the Metalogue <br>finished on was the note that blurring these lines, or creating the metaphor in the first place,<br> might not be such a good idea (having the potential to alter reality). Instead, to keep the <br>objects, ideas or things being compared separate would allow us to grip reality with assurance, <br>avoiding potential chaos and confusion.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Questions:<br></h4><br>

<ol>
<li>Since we’ve pretty much entered a time in which humanity, computers, and the web<br>
co-exist, will there need to be extra measures taken to keep the real world and the digital<br>
world apart? To a certain extent, the lines have already been blurred, so what does this<br>
mean for the future relationship between humanity and computers/the web?</li><br>
<li>Referring to the web as “sort of” human sounds potentially dangerous, so why does it<br>
seem that design keeps pushing towards a more human-like web? Is the idea that if the<br>
web acts more like us, it will make it easier to navigate? Is this true, or misguided?</li><br>
</ol>
