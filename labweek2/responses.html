<h3>Response on Found Are.na Site: <br> http://berlin.rietveldacademie.nl/wendy36/index.html </h3>

<br><br><br>

	Stumbling onto this website titled Wendy 36, it became immediately clear that <br>what I was looking at was an archival system. Dragging the cursor across the <br>screen is like shuffling through library books on a shelf, or flipping through a <br>journal. Once I looked closer into the text, the story was revealed to me in <br>snippets of text conversations, candid photographs and design work. Music was<br> also included, but because the site is four years old, the soundcloud links<br> weren’t functioning. The larger narrative revolves around the lives of a group<br> of third-year graphic design students, and archives a six week period of <br>their academic careers. <br><br>
	The website although graphically tidy, emitted a strong sense of nostalgia for me<br> (even though I have never been a student at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie<br> Amsterdam). I believe this sentiment originates from the amount of intimate<br> messages between students as well as humorous depictions of their daily life <br>scattered here and there.<br><br>
	I picked this site after brainstorming personal website ideas from last Friday’s <br>class. I realized I really wanted to make my own site an archive of my work as<br>well as a sort of time capsule. The conceptual difference between Wendy36 and <br>the site I’m aiming to create I believe, is the idea of separate “folders” of <br>time periods. Unlike Wendy36, my website will not be isolated down to a <br>specific period of time. <br><br>
