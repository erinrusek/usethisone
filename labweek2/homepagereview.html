<h3>Homepage concept:<br><br><br></h3>

I would love to make my homepage as personal as possible... So I thought what would<br> be more personal than a desktop? My plan is to make a meta-computer (I will <br>explain). When landing on the site, the viewer will need to have a passcode to enter.<br> The passcode will be hidden onscreen (or I might make it open to anything to see<br> if people try to type a password in when they don't know it). Once inside, the<br> screen will display a personal desktop complete with folders, a trash bin and a <br>profile tab. I was also thinking I might integrate Google onto it somehow to make it<br> even more meta. Each folder will contain photographs and information on works <br>I've done, ordered by year. I am planning for this to be a portfolio site as well as <br>an experience, so I want to keep it interactive. The viewer can move folders, <br>throw things in the trashbin, or even lock themselves out of the website!<br><br><br><br><br><br>
