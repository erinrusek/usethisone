<h1>Week 4: CSS</h1><br><br>
<h2>Reading Response: Writing Your Best Code</h2><br>

Shay Howe's article on organizing CSS was super helpful, but also called me out on almost everything I <br>was doing wrong (which is the point I suppose lol). It's interesting because when I first started <br>coding, I never really paid much attention to learning how to organize it. But through these past two <br>assignments, I'm realizing more and more that I won't be able to continue on with my current organization<br> system. For documentation and archival purposes, here are some of the points Howe made that I found <br>incredibly pertinent to my own methods of coding:<br><br>

<ul>
<li>Use lowercase letters within element names, attributes, and values</li>
<li>Indent nested elements</li>
<li>Strictly use double quotes, not single or completely omitted quotes</li>
<li>Remove the forward slash at the end of self-closing elements</li>
<li>Omit the values on Boolean attributes</li>
<li>always use alt because people need it if an image doesn't show/people who use text--> speech</li>
<li>clean your divs up, you don't need so many</li>
<li>Organize the code with comments</li>
<li>Make sure you're naming classes and ids keeping the future of your website in mind</li>
</ul>

<h2>Response to the Assignment:</h2><br>

Like last week's assignment, this one was hard, but allowed more freedom to explore the possibilities of <br>HTML. In terms of CSS exploration however, it was a little harder considering we were limited quite a <br>bit, making my sites seem a bit awkward. Although I did feel confined, I felt that the elements we<br> have been working with have gotten cemented into my conscious (to the point where I'm not constantly <br>checking the W3schools.com site anymore).<br>
I believe recipes 1-5 for this week were honestly a little easier to control than recipes 6-10. They were<br> also easier to format, in that I didn't have to worry about as many elements. Recipe 1 was a simple<br> exploration of div structure. Recipe 2 built on the div structure by playing with the dimensionality of<br> the webpage through different heading sizes. Page 3 I experimented with padding sizes while also <br>making the page layout more succinct, but still keeping the dimentionality. Then I decided to go off the <br>rails with recipes 4 and 5, as I discovered the beauty of the float element as well as the top, <br>bottom, right and left elements. <br>
In recipes 6-10 I added the next eight CSS elements allowed to us. Recipe 6 deals with dimentionality <br> again, but also allowed me font-freedom in which I took great liberties. Recipe 7 I used float,  <br>position, font and font-weight, and laid out a random looking recipe that is still legible through use of  <br>the float elements. Recipe 9 was an attempt to stylize the recipe and create a light feeling to  <br>the directions, while 10 did the opposite and proves quite annoying to read. <br>
