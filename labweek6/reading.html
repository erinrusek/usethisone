<h3>Starting JavaScript</h3>
<br>
<br>

	<p>
	Although pretty long, Paul Ford’s “What is Code?” was a really well-rounded analysis of the modern coder. I really<br> appreciated his explanation of the symbiosis between coders and resources like stackoverflow and W3. Although<br> not mentioned specifically, it made me feel better about looking for help and adding onto other peoples’ code <br>in order to learn. However, I did feel a little overwhelmed when Ford went into the ever-changing nature of <br>programming languages. I’m already struggling with JavaScript, so I can’t imagine coding full-time, trying to <br>teach myself another completely new language while still trying to grasp onto the others.<br><br>

Regarding JavaScript, I feel pretty stressed out with it right now. It might be because I struggle with looking at the <br>whole picture, but I just get so caught up with the concept of the function. My main issue lately is trying to <br>call the correct Id or class, and having other functions override them. That was a big problem with this week’s <br>project, but however nervous I am to use JS, I am excited to learn more in order to become confident with it. <br>
