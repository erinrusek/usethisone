	This reading was a really helpful refresher for working with HTML. It split tags <br>from the most basic (p) to the ones I had initially been confused about (<br>ol;li;ul). Not only did this text provide and contextualize various HTML <br>elements, it made sure to describe why the designer should be using HTML in the <br>first place, something I always forget in the midst of coding a site. Said <br>plainly, CSS and Javascript will allow certain aesthetic and interactive <br>qualities, while HTML is necessary for the basic understanding of the site (This <br>because it deals with the main structure of the text). <br><br><br>
	Helpful tags listed in order of mention:<br><br>
p = paragraph<br>
h1-h6 = 6 headings in HTML<br>
body = where all the content in the HTML document goes<br>
cite = used when citing a book, movie or article<br>
dfn =  lets your browser know that you’re about to define a term encased in the <br>element<br>
mark = highlights specific sections of text<br>
span = changes the color of specific sections of text<br>
q = used for quotations<br>
ol = ordered list (numbers)<br>
li = used in list formatting<br>
ul = unordered list (bullet points)<br>
strong = used to highlight inline elements<br>
figure = used to denote inline-block elements<br>
“_blank” = creates a new tab when clicking on a link<br>
