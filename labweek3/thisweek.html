	<h2>My Thoughts: Week 3</h2>

<br><br><br>
Although this week was really challenging (in terms of jumping back into HTML and <br>getting the hang of everything again), I think setting up our websites and creating <br>10 iterations of the Borscht recipe was incredibly helpful. I can now see that my<br> vision of a personal website might not be impossible to create, as I had initially <br>thought. <br>
In the Borscht iterations 1-5, I was able to re-learn the main function of HTML. In <br>Borscht version 1, I played with emphasis using the em tags. For Borscht version <br>2, I went a separate route, focusing instead on what experience highlighting <br>different words in the recipe might create. Borscht version 3 and 4 explore the uses <br>of the &nbsp function and the potential patterns the simple yet useful command <br>could have. Finally for Borscht version 5, I combined the multiple tags (em, span, br<br> and p) to create a colorful, very stylized recipe.<br>
Counterintuitively, Borscht versions 6-10 run backwards beginning with the “most”<br> changes and ending with the “least” changes. This I thought might deconstruct the <br>elements I added over time, acting as a sort of big “command-z” for future reference.<br> 
Borscht version 6 contains all tags that were acceptable to use in this assignment (<br>em, span, br, p, ul, ol, li, div, span, h1-h6 and a). In Borscht 7, the span tags<br> have been taken away, leaving the plain text. For Borscht 8 and 9, I introduced<br> links as well as a hierarchy of information. Finally at 10, the project is fully<br> deconstructed to the em, br and h1-h6 tags.<br>
