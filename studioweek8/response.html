<h2>Response: Ursula Leguin, ‘A Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction’,<br> Ted Chiang’s 'The Tower of Babylon’ <br>and Jorge Luis Borges’ ’Library of Babel’</h2><br><br><br>
 
Each of these readings managed to get me locked in existential/anxious thought on a <br>Sunday afternoon, especially Ted Chiang’s ‘The Tower of Babylon’. What Chiang’s <br>and Borges’ stories have in common is the narrative that Leguin explains in ‘A <br>Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction’. The stories Chiang and Borges tell are quite <br>similar, one describing the ascent towards the vault of heaven, and the discovery <br>that there is no way to break inside of heaven without looping back to Earth. The <br>other story describes the universe as a library full of books which, in the <br>pursuit of the meaning of it all (in the form of one book), had driven people from <br>hopeful, to despair and chaos. Interestingly enough, I believe Leguin’s <br>explanation of this “heroic” storytelling which omits the “unnecessary” fragments <br>that help the hero through their journey could be a metaphor for the trajectory in <br>which the web has grown and its limitations that have been overlooked in pursuit <br>of a greater more advanced internet. <br>
Many of the problems we have today regarding the internet revolve around subjects <br>such as corporate takeovers, fear of A.I. and the want for more freedom and across <br>this digital universe amongst others. Perhaps in a somewhat dark sense, like <br>Leguin’s fiction, the issues surrounding the internet today will never really go <br>away. They may be disguised as other issues with different heroes, but we will <br>always be facing the same issues, in an attempt to gain the perfect internet (such <br>as the search for what’s ). Like the stories, the history of the internet is one <br>big loop. Maybe however, on a lighter note, understanding this could put a bigger <br>emphasis on archiving the present like the Wayback machine, living in the now on <br>the internet and continuing to find an equilibrium no matter how the issues may <br>transform in the future. An easier way to say this might simply be to keep <br>reminding ourselves of the internet’s history, and learn how to best handle progress <br>from the positive endeavors of the past.<br>
 <br><br>
Questions:<br>

<ol> 
<li>Will there ever be a perfect internet where everyone’s wants/needs are satisfied?</li>
<li>How do we properly give credit to those which helped the “heroes” of our present in regards<br> to freeing up the web? Is it possible to do so? </li>

</ol>
